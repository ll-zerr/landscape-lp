# Landscape Landing Page

This is a modification to the [Split Landing Page project (Day 7) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the initial project was to have the browser open with a split screen holding two product images with overlays and the option to purchase the products. I wanted to utilize this base code in a website for a landscaping company. To accomplish this, I had to:

- Start the files from a boiler template created with the 50 projects-50 days initiation.
- Code up the basic HTML to reflect the original project with the addition of a navigation bar that holds a logo and nav items.
- Add the CSS styles to reflect the original project with changes to overlay and button colors.
- Create and add the logo to the navigation bar and adjust the number of nav items in the nav bar.
- Add a media query for medium screens and style the contact button in nav.
