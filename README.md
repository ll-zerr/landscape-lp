# Landscape Landing Page

This is a modification to the [Split Landing Page project (Day 7) in the Udemy course 50 projects in 50 Days](https://www.udemy.com/course/50-projects-50-days/?src=sac&kw=50+projects+50+days).

## Project Details

The goal of the initial project was to have the browser open with a split screen holding two product images with overlays and the option to purchase the products. I wanted to utilize this base code in a website for a landscaping company. To accomplish this, I had to:

## My Process

- Start the files from a boiler template created with the 50 projects-50 days initiation.
- Code up the basic HTML to reflect the original project with the addition of a navigation bar that holds a logo and nav items.
- Add the CSS styles to reflect the original project with changes to overlay and button colors.
- Create and add the logo to the navigation bar and adjust the number of nav items in the nav bar.
- Add a media query for medium screens and style the contact button in nav.
- Turn nav items into links and add effects for them on hover. 
- Change opacity of overlay to reveal more detail of images.
- Apply media queries for smaller screens. (This was a point where I needed to really evaluate the new layout and how I wanted the elements to respond here.)

### Continued development

Although a majority of applications are coded mobile first for responsive design, this particular website was designed for a desktop format first. Creating a responsive design from desktop to mobile has always been a challenge for me. This project allowed me to exercise my responsive development skills when going from desktop to mobile layouts.
